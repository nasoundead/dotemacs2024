  1. Optional properties :local and/or :append, which will make the hook
     buffer-local or append to the list of hooks (respectively),
  2. The hooks: either an unquoted major mode, an unquoted list of major-modes,
     a quoted hook variable or a quoted list of hook variables. If unquoted, the
     hooks will be resolved by appending -hook to each symbol.
  3. A function, list of functions, or body forms to be wrapped in a lambda.

Examples:
    (add-hook! 'some-mode-hook 'enable-something)   (same as `add-hook')
    (add-hook! some-mode '(enable-something and-another))
    (add-hook! '(one-mode-hook second-mode-hook) 'enable-something)
